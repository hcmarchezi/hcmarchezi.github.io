We just finished to deliver our first big .NET system with a 4-Layered
Architecture and domain objects. The proof-of-concepts is done also for
big systems.  
  
Because we use a 4-Layered Architecture, the same business rules
describe in the Task Layer (or Service Layer, as you wish) are applied
to both the desktop and the web versions of the application.  
  
NHibernate has also proven its value showing that it has enough
performance for any kind of systems. I am anxious to start building
other layered object-oriented systems like this.
